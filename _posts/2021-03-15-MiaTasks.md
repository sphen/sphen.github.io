I founded a freelance studio, [Raft Creative](https://www.raftcreative.com), in June 2020 as a way to help support myself and two friends through the Covid-19 pandemic. We needed a way to keep our day to day tasks organized, but had no need for a full blown team management platform like Trello or Asana. So I made us one.

The app gives us what we need, a snapshot of what has been and what needs to be done, without all the extras normally found in task manager apps. The code is available on GitHub for anyone to clone and use for their own purposes.

## Details

The app is built on the Mongo, Express, React, and Node stack.

Check out the demo app [here](https://miatasks.herokuapp.com/).
It's hosted on a heroku free dyno, so it may take a few seconds to wake up.

View the [github](https://github.com/sphen/mia-tasks) for more information.
