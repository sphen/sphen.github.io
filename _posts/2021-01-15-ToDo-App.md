A javascript game to do list that I created to practice css styles and animations. Ended up being inspired to create a full task managment app from the basic javascript version.

## Details

The app is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Tasks and task list name are kept in local storage.

Check out the demo [here](#).
