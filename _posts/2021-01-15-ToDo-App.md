A javascript game to do list that I created to practice css styles and animations. Ended up being inspired to create a full task managment app from the basic javascript version.

Words come from the [Oxford CEFR 3000/5000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000). 'Easy' difficulty shows the input text and 'Normal' difficulty hides it. Both pull words from CEFR A1. 'Hard' hides the input text and pulls words from CEFR C1.

## Details

The app is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Tasks and task list name are kept in local storage.

Check out the demo [here](#).
