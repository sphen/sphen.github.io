A javascript game where you have to type the given word before time runs out. Players can set difficulty the want to play at.

Words come from the [Oxford CEFR 3000/5000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000). 'Easy' difficulty shows the input text and 'Normal' difficulty hides it. Both pull words from CEFR A1. 'Hard' hides the input text and pulls words from CEFR C1.

## Details

Scores and difficulty are kept in local storage. Will circle back and upgrade to an actual DB at some point.

The game is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Check out the demo [here](https://sphen.net/typetime/).
