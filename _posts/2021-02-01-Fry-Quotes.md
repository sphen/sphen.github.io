I recently rebuilt the first API I ever built, Fry Quotes API. It was originally a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) to build the front end of a quote generator, I could not find any quote generating apis that I wanted to use, so I decided to learn how to build my own.

The API was a cobbled together mess of what little javascript (jquery) I knew at the time, but it functioned, and I was quite proud of myself when it actually worked. Nothing is quite like your first time, but I'm equally as proud of how much better this new version is.

## Details

A quote generator that serves up random quotes by Philip J Fry from the show Futurama.

The API is built on MongoDB, Express, and Node. The frontend is good old HTML/CSS/JS.

Check out the working quote generator [here](https://sphen.net/fry-quotes-frontend/)

View the [api github](https://github.com/sphen/fry-quotes-api) and [front-end github](https://github.com/sphen/fry-quotes-frontend) for more information.
