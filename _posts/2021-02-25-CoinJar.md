I, like a lot of people, have a coin jar that I dump my change in at the end of the day. I realized I never really knew how much change was actually in there, so I built this app to make it super easy to keep track.

## Details

The app is built on the Mongo, Express, React, and Node stack.

Check out the demo app [here](https://coinjar-sphen.herokuapp.com/).
It's hosted on a heroku free dyno, so it may take a few seconds to wake up.

View the [github](https://github.com/sphen/coin-jar) for more information.
