I redesigned and rewrote my personal site over winter. This time using Jekyll to power the blog. Before I even finished though I got the desire to start all over again with React/Gatsby - it's just better. So this version of sphen.net will be short lived, dead before it really lived.

## Details

The site is built with the usual suspects: HTML/CSS/JS, with Jekyll powering the 'blog'.

View the [github](https://github.com/sphen/sphen.github.io) for more information.
