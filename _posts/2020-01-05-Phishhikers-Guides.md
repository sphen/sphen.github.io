I hadn't used Jekyll prior (or any static site generator) but it turned out to be quite intuitive and actually spurred me to convert my personal site over to the static site generator.

The site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on top of the [Poole](https://getpoole.com/) theme by Mark Otto.
