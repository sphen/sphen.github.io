**sphen** is short for [spheniscidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin), but my friends call me Zac. I'm a developing developer, designer, and wannabe professional cheesecake taster. I created this website to serve as a depot for things I learn and create.

I originally learned to code in order to automate as many monotonous tasks as possible at a non-CS job but ended up falling in love with code and have been learning ever since.

I am currently particularly interested in learning web development and data analysis. As well as how to make the world's best cheesecake.
